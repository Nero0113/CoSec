Code for our paper "On-the-Fly Security Hardening of Code LLMs via Supervised Co-Decoding"

## Directory Structure

The directory structure of this repository is shown as below:

```
.
|-- data_train_val    # Dataset for training and validation 
|-- data_eval          # Dataset for evaluation
|-- results	            # Experimental results
|-- scripts             # Scripts for training and inference
|-- trained	           # Trained LoRA for security.
|-- transformers	   # The source code of transformers version 4.33.0 obtained from the
                           # official website, as well as our proposed security hardening
                           # generation framework.

```

We used the same training and validation data as [SVEN](https://github.com/eth-sri/sven).

## ðŸ”¨ Setup

```
conda create -n code_sec python==3.8
conda activate code_sec
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## ðŸš€ Train

To train a LoRA for security yourself, run:

```
$ python train_lora_sec.py
```

## ðŸš€ Inference
To generate security-hardened code, run:
```
$ python generate.py
```
To perform security evaluation and functional correctness evaluation, you can simply replace the follow code in SVEN's code with our 'model.generate_with_experts':
